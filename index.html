            <div>
                <p> During the first week of the intro to programing course, I've attempted to create multiple projects
                </p>
                <p> Below is a list of the projects in order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Hello World:</em> This was my first project so I was just getting the hang of how HTML works</li>
                    <li><em>Animal Shelter:</em> During this project I learned more about styling with CSS</li>
                    <p>Check it out here <a href="https://github.com/ShanaySharif/Animal-shelter">Animals</a>.</p>


                    <li><em>Interior Design:</em>Here is another project that required some HTML and css 
                        <p>Check it out here</p> <a href="https://github.com/ShanaySharif/Interior-designn">HTML Practice</a>.</p>

                <h2> My background</h2>
                <p>I have a bachelors degree from <em>The University of Washington</em>. Some of my job experiance consists of working at a law firm as well as a financial firm. I've been interested in coding for a couple of years but after doing some extensive research about bootcamps, I've decided to enroll at Epicodus. My plan is to graduate from this program and find a job in tech!</p>
                <p>My favorite things to do in no particular order are:</p>

                

                <ul>
                    <li>Hiking/doing out door activites </li>
                    <li>Watching Netflix after a long day </li>
