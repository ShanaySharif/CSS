                <h2> My background</h2>
                <p>I have a bachelors degree from the University of Washington. Some of my job experiance consists of working at a law firm as well as a financial firm. I've been interested in coding for a couple of years but after doing some extensive research about bootcamps, I've decided to enroll at Epicodus. My plan is to graduate from this program and find a job in tech!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hiking/doing out door activites </li>
                    <li>Watching Netflix after a long day </li>
