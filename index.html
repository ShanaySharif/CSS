        <p> During the first week of the intro to programing course, I've attempted to create multiple projects
        </p>
        <p> Below is a list of the projects in order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Hello World:</em> This was my first project so I was just getting the hang of how HTML works
            </li>
            <li><em>Animal Shelter:</em> During this project I learned more about styling with CSS</li>
            <p>Check it out here <a href="https://github.com/ShanaySharif/Animal-shelter">Animals</a>.</p>


            <li><em>Interior Design:</em>Here is another project that required some HTML and css
                <p>Check it out here</p> <a href="https://github.com/ShanaySharif/Interior-designn">HTML
                    Practice</a>.</p>

        <h2> My Background</h2>
        <p>I have a bachelors degree from <em>The University of Washington</em>. Some of my job experiance consists
            of working at a law firm as well as a financial firm. I've been interested in coding for a couple of
            years but after doing some extensive research about bootcamps, I've decided to enroll at Epicodus. My
            plan is to graduate from this program and find a job in tech!</p>
        <p>My favorite things to do in no particular order are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hiking/doing out door activites </li>
            <li>Watching Netflix after a long day </li>
            <li>Eating</li>
